      <h3> About me </h3>
      <p> I'm a 26-year-old student at the <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> coding boot camp, as well as a student at CSUF. I have worked in various industries, including service, retail, and tech. I love meeting and working with new people due to always learning something new from my colleagues. Making new and meaningful connections with people in the development field is exciting. I look forward to meeting and learning from you along the way! I've been interested in most tech-related fields since a young age, but only recently taught myself to code. As I began to learn the basics, I started to enjoy the process of coding.</p>
